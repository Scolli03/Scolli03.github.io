      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>My name is Shain Collins. I have worked in the field of data automation and custom software solutions for 4
        years. My passions are coding, gaming, building, and just about anything else related to computers. I like
        spending time with my friends and family, and while I am not and instructor. I do enjoy helping and teaching
        others...and an occasional glass of whiskey!</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img src="images/python.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Like many developers in recent years, I got my start with Python. What started as making better use of my
          downtime at my current place of employment ended up saving the company and average of $55,000 a year in time
          savings alone! This became a pivotal skill that completely altered the course of my career. I started learning
          Python 10 minutes at a time. Now I get to code all the time! </p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="csharp-icon" src="images/c_sharp.png" alt="">
        <h3>C# .NET</h3>
        <p>As my skills began to grow, so did the demand for them. Crazy I know! I was lucky to be employed where the
          potential for these skills were not underestimated. As more and more departments had ideas of their own as how
          to increase productivity and reduce cost through custom tools, I was faced with the challenge of how to make
          sure everyone had the resources necessary to run my programs. I love the tools and capabilities that the .net
          ecosystem has to offer including the ability to easily distribute my work to anyone in the company. I have
          also dived
          headfirst into the new world of .net core and all of its new and exciting features!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="sql-icon" src="images/sql.webp" alt="">
        <h3>SQL</h3>
        <p>Soon it was not enough to just process data. We needed to store it, generate reports from it, and allow end
          users to alter some of it without “giving up farm” regarding access and control. When I started programming,
          we used and Access database file. While it did the job, it posed challenges when it came to leveraging the
          data within from multiple applications. As the business grew, we eventually upgraded to SQL Server. I knew I
          had to do everything I could to learn how to leverage what SQL Server has to offer. While there is still even
          more to learn, I will say that upwards of 90% of our internal applications now leverage the SQL Server.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="vba-icon" src="images/vba.png" alt="">
        <h3>VBA</h3>
        <p>Excel is still one of the most used software’s to store and manipulate data. Every business in every industry
          will likely leverage excel at some level. It is no different where I work. Before my programming days there
          was so much copying and pasting of data from this excel file to that excel file. Making sure you do not mess
          up the formatting or formulas when pasting here or there. And there were so many people making manual edits to
          information that when there was an error it was hard to figure out where and why it arose. Once I got into
          programming, I decided this skill that was not only a benefit, but essentially a requirement. Not only has it
          helped us internally via Excel and other VBA integrated software’s such as PolyWorks, but we have also helped
          develop macros for other international companies!</p>
